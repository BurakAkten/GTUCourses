	*This code find a root of a function by using Bisection Method.
	*In this code there is a function to test the code. You can change the 
	 function to try any function.

-----
	*The other file which name is Questions.txt includes results of functiouns 
	 which is
		- f(x) = 3*x -e^x                 1 <= x <= 2
		- f(x) = 2*x + 3*cos(x) - e^x     0 <= x <= 1
		- f(x) = x^2 - 4*x + 4 - ln(x)    1 <= x <= 2
		- f(x) = x^2 - 4*x + 4 - ln(x)    2 <= x <= 4
		- f(x) = x + 1 -2*sin(pi*x)       0 <= x <= 0.5
		- f(x) = x + 1 -2*sin(pi*x)       0.5<=x <= 1

--To run these code you can do these on your linux machine.
	* run the command on terminal  
		-$make
	*Then you will have a runable 'exe' file.
	*then write this with command line parameters
		-$./exe startingRoot stoppingRoot stoppinCriteria epsilonValue
	
	*If you want to see results of these function that I mentioned above , it's 
	enough to append -DX end of the 7th line of makefile. 
		-DX => X = A for the first function
			=> X = B for the second function 
			=> X = C for the third function 
			=> X = D for the fouth function that I mentioned above.
